# **alph** - <b>al</b>tair for your gra<b>ph</b>

A Python library using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for declarative, data-driven network visualisation.

<p align="center"><img alt="Alph graph" src="examples/images/small_graph.png" width=60%/></p>

## Why

Tidy, legible graph visualisations can be elusive. Alph helps by bringing together effective styling, layout and pruning options from across the Python ecosystem.

## How it works

1. Get your data into a NetworkX Graph
2. Pick a network layout function, or bring your own node coordinates
3. Define node and edge style attributes
4. Plot using a simple function call

Best bet is probably to dive straight into the [examples](./examples/), and come back to the API documentation below as needed.

## Features

- plot any NetworkX Graph
- support for any layout expressed as a NetworkX `pos` structure (a dict like `{node_id: (x,y), ...}`)
- several readily accessible and tunable layout functions (see [example](examples/3_layouts_gallery.ipynb))
- Altair-style data driven node and edge styling - size, colour, stroke, opacity, scales, conditionals and more
- convenience args for node labels, halos
- experimental 1-level "combo" node support

## Installation

### Minimal

```
pip install alph
```

### Recommended

1. for graphviz layout support, install graphviz on your platform - e.g. `brew install graphviz` on Mac,
   `sudo apt install graphviz` on Debian / Ubuntu etc - or [download the installer](https://graphviz.org/download/)

2. Install alph with graphviz support:
   ```
   pip install alph[graphviz]
   ```
3. Install the ForceAtlas2 layout library from our fork, along with cython for speedup
   ```
   pip install cython git+https://github.com/connectedcompany/forceatlas2.git
   ```

> #### Why is the ForceAtlas2 install separate?
>
> [ForceAtlas2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679) is a classic,
> user feedback led layout algorithm from the [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) team, and the [ForceAtlas2 library](https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2)
> implementation is an excellent, performant Python port. There are two things to be aware of:
>
> 1. **GPL licence** - the ForceAtlas2 library, and some of the works it is derived from, are GPL licensed -
>    hence care is needed when distributing and linking to it. We thus intend to keep its install optional
>    long term. Since alph uses a plugin design for layout providers, this is straightforward for us to
>    accommodate, and maintain explicit separation for use cases where GPL is an issue.
>
> 2. **Our fork** - recently, releases of the library have been sporradic - though there is stated intent for
>    regular maintenance to resume. In the meantime, we've created a temporary fork to be able to roll in
>    changes. Currently, our fork incorporates a simple change that enables deterministic layouts.

## Usage

Simply call the `alph` function with desired options.

Minimally, given a weighted network G:

```
from alph import alph

G = ...
alph(G, weight_attr="weight")
```

## Examples

See [`examples`](./examples). Here's a taster:

- Some of the supported layouts (from the [layouts gallery example](examples/3_layouts_gallery.ipynb)):

- Use of geolocation coordinates for graph layout, (from the [flight routes example](examples/5_flight_routes.ipynb)):
  ![Geo-location based layout](examples/images/flight_routes.png)

- A styled interaction network (from the [dolphins example](examples/4_dolphins.ipynb)):

- "Combo"-style layout (experimental) - category-driven node grouping with edge weight aggregation, from the [Les Mis example](examples/6_les_mis_experimental_combo.ipynb):

## Tips

- Get to know your layout algos - especially the 2-3 most used ones. They can have a dramatic
  effect on the results. A combination of FA2, Spring and Fruchterman is extremely versatile
  if set up right.
- Pass `seed` to layout functions where possible, for repeatable layouts
- Set padding to ensure node elements stay within figure boundaries

## Known limitations

- Node `size` attribute does not support all Altair options - currently only
  `alt.value` and `alt.Size` with linear `domain` and `range` scales. More can be
  added as needed.

  This is a design choice, made to not burden the user with calculating things like
  label and halo positions when node sizes vary. Will review this tradeoff based
  on in-use experience.

- One combo level currently supported
